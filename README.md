# "# project-overview-writeup-davemcdonald617" 

## Description:

The main purpose of my project will be to track the first year salaries of recent ISU Graduates. Along with this, I hope to implement tracking of Major, Minor, GPA, Career field, Sex(M or F), location of employment and any other points that may help in this area. 

## Audience:

The audience for this project is ISU students. More specifically those close to graduation or those just getting out into the career field and need information on salaries to help with planning, expectations, negotiations, etc. 

## Why I chose this:

This is something that interests me as I am usually looking into the future a little bit and trying to plan ahead. When starting a job after graduating, it would be very beneficial to have this information. This could also help students make decisions on Majors, Minors, etc. I also think this has a good number of components to it and will make for a good project.

## Plans with this project after class ends:

As of now, I have no plans for this project after class ends. Although, I think this will be good to have in a portfolio. 

## Working alone or in a group:

For this project, I will be working alone.

## Minimum Viable Product:

The MVP for this project is to be able to handle the data for the starting salary of recent graduates of ISU. By handle I mean store, display, accept new, group into common fields and transform the data into meaningful information.
